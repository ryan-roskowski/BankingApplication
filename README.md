# BankingApplication

BankingApplication provides all the business logic for an application for a banking system. Users/Customers/Employees/Accounts
can be loaded from a default built in data object, a file, or an oracle database. All source files are found in /src/. This project
can be run in a terminal using the clientsim program which acts as a client simulator. In another repository called BankingWebApp, 
I have given the Banking App a web UI using servlets and JSPs. It takes this project as a dependency and uses the business logic of this project.
